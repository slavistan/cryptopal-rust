# Defining a measure between bitsets

Let the **mass of a byte** denote its number of set bits.

$$
\hm(u) := \text{Number of set bits in }u
$$

Further extend this notion to let the **mass of a byteset** be the total number of set bits over the whole set.

$$
\hm(U) := \sum \limits_{u \in U} \hm(u)
$$

Let the **density of a byteset** be the average number of set bits.

$$
\hdens(U) := \frac{1}{\|U\|} \cdot \hm(U)
$$

Let the **distance between to bytes** be defined as the number of differing bits, which is equal to the mass of their antivalence

$$
\hdist{u}{v} := \text{Number of differing bits} = \hm(u \xor v)
$$

# TODO BELOW HERE
Let the **average distance between two bytesets** be defined as the average number of bits that differ between any two members of the subsets.

$$
H(V, W) := \frac{1}{\|V \times W \|} \sum \limits_{v \in V, w \in W} H(v, w) = \frac{1}{\|V\| \cdot \|W\|} \sum \limits_{v \in V, w \in W} H(v \xor w)
$$

The Hamming-distance of any byteset with respect to itself is less than the Hamming-distance between any two differing bytesets.

We guess a key size and over the set of every pair of two chiffre characters $(\epsilon_r, \epsilon_s)$, which were (ostensibly) encrypted by a common letter from the key, we compute the average distance $\sigma$. Note that if the chiffre is large in comparison to the key a smaller subset of all pairs will suffice as a representative approximation.

$$
\begin{matrix}
   \|\sigma\| \cdot \sigma = \color{green}{\hdist{\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_n}}     &\color{green}{+}  &\color{green}{\hdist{\epsilon_n}{\epsilon_{2n}}}       &\color{green}{+} &\color{green}{\hdist{\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_{2n}}}   &\color{green}{+} &\color{green}{\cdots} \\
 &\color{blue}{+} &\color{blue}{\hdist{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_{n+1}}} &\color{blue}{+} &\color{blue}{\hdist{\epsilon_{n+1}}{\epsilon_{2n+1}}} &\color{blue}{+} &\color{blue}{\hdist{\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_{2n+1}}} &\color{blue}{+} &\color{blue}{\cdots} \\
 &+ &\vdots               &+ &\vdots                    &+ &\vdots                &+ &\ddots
\end{matrix}
$$

If we guessed the correct key size each pair's distance decays into the distance of the corresponding cleartext characters. The xor-operation is commutative, associative and self-inverse and thus the identical keys cancel themselves out.

$$
\hdist{\epsilon_r}{\epsilon_s} = \hdist{k \xor l_r}{k \xor l_s} = \hmass{(k \xor l_r) \xor (k \xor l_s)} = \hmass{l_r \xor l_s} = \hdist{l_r}{l_s}
$$

Thus, assuming that the set of pairs is large enough to be representative, the average distance will approximate the mean distance of the source alphabet $A$ with respect to itself.

$$
\sigma \approx \frac{1}{\|A\|^2} \cdot \sum \limits_{a_1 \in A, a_2\in A} \hdist{a_1}{a_2}
$$
